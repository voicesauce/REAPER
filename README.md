# REAPER fork for OpenSauce

This is a fork of Ryuichi Yamamoto's REAPER repository, which itself is a fork
of Google's [REAPER](https://github.com/google/REAPER) project.  We use this
Git repo as a submodule in our
[fork](https://github.com/voicesauce/pyreaper) of the Python package
[pyreaper](https://github.com/r9y9/pyreaper).

We've made a few minor modifications to the REAPER code, for the purpose
of running REAPER F0 estimation measurements in our main software project
[OpenSauce](https://github.com/voicesauce/opensauce-python).
